# vortexv1.0
HOW TO USE-
If you're using the web version which will probably get blocked by your school very fast, there should be a blue link ending with .github.io at the top right usually. If not it will definetely be somewhere on the page.

ATTENTION THIS IS THE BEST WAY-
This is a very easy way to acces these apps, the only problem with this is that you can't connect to the internet so no online games:(
